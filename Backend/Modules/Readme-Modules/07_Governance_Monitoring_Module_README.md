- Supports investigation and regulatory examination processes

### ðŸ”¹ Explainability-Agent
**Purpose**: Provides human-readable explanations for all AI-driven outputs and decisions with advanced interpretability.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Model interpretability libraries (SHAP, LIME, counterfactuals)
- Natural language explanation generation
- Feature provenance tracking and data lineage
- Scenario explorer for "what-if" and sensitivity testing
- Multi-stakeholder explanation support (RMs, auditors, regulators)
- Decision transparency and accountability

**Instructions**:
- Provides human-readable explanations for all AI outputs
- Generates attribution maps and confidence bands for decisions
- Attaches explanation artifacts directly to outputs
- Links decisions to underlying features and data provenance
- Allows "what-if" queries to explore alternate outcomes
- Supports multiple stakeholder needs and requirements
