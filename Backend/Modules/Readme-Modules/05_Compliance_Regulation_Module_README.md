- Map the corporate ownership structure and identify beneficial owners
- Run risk scoring and determine if enhanced due diligence is required
- Generate KYC report with recommendations
""")
```

### AML Monitoring
```python
from Compliance_Regulation_Module import AML_agent

# Analyze suspicious transactions
response = AML_agent.run("""
Analyze suspicious transaction patterns:
- Monitor recent transactions for structuring and layering patterns
- Apply ML models to detect anomalous behavior
- Generate SARs for high-risk transactions
- Link related alerts into investigation cases
""")
```
